## Description
A small Julia package developed for a neuronal bifurcations minicourse mostly geared towards creating custom plots and running numerical simulations. Credit for the original course and Python code upon which this is based goes to [@nalewkoz](https://github.com/nalewkoz).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin make sure you have Julia v1.6 or higher (Tests were not yet developed for older versions)

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/neuro-myoung/NeuralDynamics.jl.git
```

Then be sure to add the package contents to your development environment. From the package manager type the following.

```
]dev NeuralDynamics
```
Then you will be able to import the package as with any other Julia package
```
using NeuralDynamics
```

## Examples
**Documentation** to come...
For now here are some examples of plots made with this package:

### Analyzing Bifurcations

Detailed examples with interactive plotting available in the Pluto notebook.

### Ising Simulation
```
Tc = 2/log(1+sqrt(2));
	
mutable struct Parameters
	Nx::Int32      # nrows
	Ny::Int32      # ncols
	J::Float64     # interaction strength (nearest neighbors)
	T::Float64     # temperature (kb = 1)
	h::Float64     # external field
	Mâ‚€::Float64    # initial magnetization
end
	
params = Parameters(150, 150, 1, Tc/2.5, 0, 0.5)
Mhist, X = simulateIsing2D(params, 2000000);
```
