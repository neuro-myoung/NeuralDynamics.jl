## Description
A small Julia package developed for a neuronal bifurcations minicourse mostly geared towards creating custom plots and running numerical simulations. Credit for the original course and Python code upon which this is based goes to [@nalewkoz](https://github.com/nalewkoz).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin make sure you have Julia v1.6 or higher (Tests were not yet developed for older versions)

## Installation

From the Julia package REPL type 
```
] add NeuralDynamics
```
or you can install using Pkg by typing
```
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("NeuralDynamics")
```
Then you will be able to import the package as with any other Julia package
```
using NeuralDynamics
```

## Functionality

### Simulate Neurons or networks of neurons

Build neuron or network models and study them in the phase plane or simulate their activity.

Currently implemented models:
- FitzHughNagumo
- WilsonCowan
- Simple Feedforward

Build your own custom models and analyze them!

### Ising Simulation
```
Tc = 2/log(1+sqrt(2));
	
mutable struct Parameters
	Nx::Int32      # nrows
	Ny::Int32      # ncols
	J::Float64     # interaction strength (nearest neighbors)
	T::Float64     # temperature (kb = 1)
	h::Float64     # external field
	Mâ‚€::Float64    # initial magnetization
end
	
params = Parameters(150, 150, 1, Tc/2.5, 0, 0.5)
Mhist, X = simulateIsing2D(params, 2000000);
```

Display the results of the simulation:

You can find interactive Pluto notebooks in the notebook folder.
